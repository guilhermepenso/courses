                <h2>First Version</h2>
                <p>
                    The first try to create a mascot came in 2007 from a developer called Dan Morrill. He tells that he opened Inkscape (Free software for vectoring images) and created his own robot version. His objective was to only personify the system for his team, without any company requesting for a mascot creation.

                <p>
                    This bizarre first version was baptized as an tribute to it's creator: the Dandroids.
                </p>
                <h2>A New Mascot Arise</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea to have a new mascot was maturing and the mission was passed to a professional in the area. The illustrator Russa Irina Blok, also working at Google, got the missions to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.

                <p>
                    Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with less traces and in a more plate shape. The drawing also should needed a fast and easy recognition by the look. And then was created the Bugdroid, the new Android's Mascot.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroid">
                <p>
                    The main inspiration for the traces and shapes from Bugdroid was taken from the dolls that identify the genre in doors for bathrooms. Story told that the artist was creating from it's office on Google and looked to the bathroom, identifying it with ease, simple and clean from it's objective.

                            Unfortunately, Android Q wasn't created, as Google ended this fun practice and began using numbers, giving birth to Android 10.
